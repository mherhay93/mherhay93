### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a frontend developer, I have gained experience working on various projects, including e-commerce platforms, delivery services, security administration, and user interfaces. Currently, I am involved in a project within the betting industry where I am developing a business-scale system for running and managing casinos and sportsbooks. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work on a full-stack project where I developed both user-facing web pages and the admin panel. 
Thank you for considering my profile.
